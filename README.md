# Forecasting Monthly Unemployment Rate
The unemployment rate forecast is defined as the projected value for the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labor force, where the latter consists of the unemployed plus those in paid or self-employment. Unemployed people are those who report that they are without work, that they are available for work, and that they have taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks.
